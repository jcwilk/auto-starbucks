A silly tool built out of annoyance at Starbucks

Every 30 minutes they force you to get redirected to auth to login again, which just requires pushing a button surrounded by javascript garbage...

...so why not write a script to do it! This presumably requires you to log in once... maybe specifically from chrome? I don't really care it's just a junky script.
